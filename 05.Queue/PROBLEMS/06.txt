Problem Statement



You are tasked with implementing a priority queue for a hospital's emergency room. The emergency room receives patients with different levels of severity, and it's crucial to treat patients based on their priority. 



The program should allow the hospital staff to do the following:

Add patients to the priority queue: The staff should be able to enter the patient's age and severity level. The severity level is an integer value that indicates the urgency of the patient's condition, where a lower value represents a higher priority.
View the current queue: The staff should be able to view the list of patients in the queue, ordered by their priority.
Input format :
The first line of input consists of an integer N, representing the number of elements in the priority queue.

The following N lines consist of two space-separated integers: data and priority values.

Output format :
The output prints the elements of the priority queue in order of their priority.

If the priority queue is empty, it prints the message "Priority queue is empty"



Refer to the sample output for the exact text and format.

Code constraints :
The value of N, representing the number of elements in the priority queue, should be a non-negative integer.

The data and priority values entered should be integers.

The priority values should be non-negative integers.

Sample test cases :
Input 1 :
5
12 5
45 3
78 2
36 4
95 1
Output 1 :
Priority queue elements: 95 78 45 36 12 
Input 2 :
3
12 2
45 3
78 1
Output 2 :
Priority queue elements: 78 12 45 
Input 3 :
0
Output 3 :
Priority queue elements: Prio
